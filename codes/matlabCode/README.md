# Introduction

These matlab files are used to preprocess the data

# Usage

* The starting point is the `mainFunc.m` type in the function you want to use.
For example: `my_make_heat_map` is used to generate the heatmap, `write_mat2csv` is used to generate `csv` files from
the given `.mat` for the `superC` and `langenFeld` data. The `write_mat2csv_frank` is used to generate data for the `Frankfurt` and 
`Seoul` cities data.

You could run directly the script `mainFunc.m` or you could also open a terminal and run the `runMe.sh` bash script

* For the `write_mat2csv_frank` , there are several antenna pattern applicable. For that you need to include the data folder, which are generated by [Aleksandar Ichkov ](mailto:aic@inets.rwth-aachen.de)
