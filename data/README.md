# Introduction

This folder contain all the useful data for the generation of the plottings.

There are two main subfolders

* `matlabData` which is the data generated from the raytracing experiments converted to `csv` for further processing (used by the `cpp` code for correlation analysis)
* `estimationData` is the folder which contains the calculated estimator data, which can further be used for plotting. Note that the python code will also generate the `angularPower spectrum` in the corresponding folders.
